# if, else if and else statements

The basic idea is simple

```
if (condition)
{
    do something
}
else if (condition)
{
    do something else
}
.... as many else if statements
else
{
    if none of those conditions are met, do something else
}
```

In C It is NOT mandatory to have an 'else' statement with 'if' or 'elif' as per my understanding
